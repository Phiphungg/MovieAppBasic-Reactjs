# React + Vite

This is a simple project built with ReactJS, Vite, and Tailwind. The website offers basic features such as rendering a list of movies, searching, and fetching data from third-party APIs. The creator utilized useState, useEffect, and Context to develop this website.

One of the website's features is that when clicking on any movie from the list, the trailer of that movie will be displayed.

The project is deployed on Vercel for easier accessibility.

UPDATE: The project encountered an image display issue after being deployed on Vercel.
